## Compiling mk64 Decomp In Windows

But with this setup normally work in 99% of the cases. But keep in mind some issue can append because the os windows don't make a great support for programmation.

### Requirements
- Clone the repo or download the zip on your computer
- Dowload toolchain from [here](https://github.com/coco875/mk64-tools/releases/download/v0.0.4/mips-tools-chain-windows.zip)

### Setup
1. Extract the toolchain in the same folder as the repo (so merge the tools folder with the one who are in zip)
2. Open a terminal (cmd or powershell) in the repo folder and run `"tools/mingw64/bin/make"`
3. Wait for the build to finish and Enjoy!
